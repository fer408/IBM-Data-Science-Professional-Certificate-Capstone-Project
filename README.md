# IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate-Capstone-Project
The capstone project I used in order to receive a Professional Certificate in Data Science from IBM.

The premise is that for business owners interested in starting a wing shop near an area which is not currently being serviced by any 
nearby competing Wing Shops thus making it a better decision based on the fact that starting a wing store near an area with a surplus 
of other wing shops will make it tough to start and maintain the business as opposed to being somewhere where you are the only shop 
nearby in the neighbourhood. The neighbourhood Wing Shop.
